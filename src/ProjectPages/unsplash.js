                    <h6>Project</h6>
                    <p><a href='https://www.unsplash.com'>Unsplash</a> is a stock photography website which gives photographers a platform to share their work to a 
                        worldwide audience. Their website states the overall goal of “celebrating and enabling contributors and 
                        fostering creativity in our community and their manifesto is built on the three pillars of “Share, Care, and 
                        Create”. I used the <a href='https://www.thegymnasium.com/courses/GYM/103/0/about'>Learn - Design - Build - 
                        Test</a> method of UX design to reshape the website.</p>
                    <h6>Role</h6>
                    <p>I have conducted this project entirely by myself, taking on the roles of User Researcher, UX/UI Designer, 
                        Content Strategist, and a small amount of Front End Web Development work.</p>

                        I have used Unsplash to host my own pictures and to search for images to use in various projects for several
                         years. This is for the most part a seamless process. However, I believe that there remain areas for
                        improvement in streamlining the user’s experience and expanding on their goals for community engagement. 
                        Building on the principle of <a href='https://www.sarahdoody.com/the-big-impact-of-small-changes/#.XszcumgvNPY'>
                        "small changes, big effects”</a>, I aim to research and implement several
                        small quality of life adjustments to the website for desktop and laptop users. The form these adjustments
                        take will arise out of my user research.

                        I am in no way affiliated with Unsplash. Their website design is fantastic as it is and I am sure they have 
                        worked incredibly hard on making it as accessible and streamlined as possible. I do not have access to any of 
                        the analytics they no doubt use extensively to make their decisions. This is purely a practice project for 
                        myself to improve my UX design skills. I do not advocate that Unsplash use any of my designs on 
                        their website.</em>

                        <p><em>Manifesto and Challenges</em></p>
                        <p>Unsplash’s manifesto highlights how they focus more on the free availability of images rather than 
                            appealing to commercial buyers. They assert that the company has a responsibility to help everyone to 
                            create and share their work. </p>
                        <CardImg src={manifesto} className='project-images d-none d-sm-block'></CardImg>
                        <p>Unsplash’s website uses a minimalist, monochrome design. In all my redesigns I have challenged myself 
                            to adhere to this philosophy as if instructed to do so during a real commission by the company. Whereas 
                            normally <a href="https://designmodo.com/color-attention-design/">a large amount of colour</a> might be used to improve the user’s experience navigating the site 
                            , I will attempt to use other means to draw attention and highlight points of interest. I will 
                            only use colours already appearing on the website and will attempt to use them in similar areas as they 
                            are currently displayed.</p>

                        <p><em>Competitor Analysis</em></p>
                        <p>There are two main competitor websites which also host stock photography freely uploaded by contributors; 
                            Pexels and Pixabay. I consulted <a href='https://www.slant.co/topics/1096/versus/~pexels_vs_unsplash_vs_pixabay'>existing research</a> on these companies to uncover how users feel about their 
                            design and experience compared to Unsplash currently.

                    <Col md={{size: 8, offset: 2}}>
                        <p>This research revealed several aspects on which Unsplash could focus to please its users:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The “Free” licensing aspect:</strong> highlighting this seems important to users of all three sites.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incentivising photographers: </strong> this is an area in which Unsplash appears to lag behind its competitors. 
                                Participants mentioned the presence of a “Donate” button and challenge rewards on Pexels as a Pro of 
                                the website and the belief that Unsplash makes money off of contributors’ work as a Con of the site. 
                                NB: This was also mentioned in an <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/10/07/i-tried-unsplash-for-two-years-heres-what-i-learned/">article</a> I consulted as a reason why one photographer stopped using 
                                Unsplash to host his photographs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community:</strong> users mentioned social links and the user community as pros of both 
                            Unsplash and other sites.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                <Row>
                    <Col md={{size: 8, offset: 2}}> 
                    <p><em>Initial User Impressions</em></p>
                    <p>I interviewed three participants who had not used the site before and noted their initial impressions. Again, 
                        it became apparent that the “free license” offered by Unsplash incentivised users to look through the site 
                        further. One participant mentioned that her usual alternative for finding pictures (Google Images) often felt 
                        “a little like stealing” due to the presence of watermarks or the use of images by other sites. The “join now” 
                        button in the top-right corner was also mentioned repeatedly as the use of colour in an otherwise monochrome 
                        landing page drew the eye. </p>

                    <p>I gave each participant 8 tasks to complete on the website (see examples below). Each task was presented orally and with written 
                        instructions. I observed each participant attempting the tasks and noted any difficulties or pain points they

                        would have asked more people and this may well have bumped Unsplash up to the highest grade). This rating

                    <p>From combining the issues that became apparent from these charts with the feedback from my participants, 
                        I sorted common issues into areas of the site to improve. As we can see, the three largest areas for 
                        improvement are the Landing Page, Search, and Image Info. Due to limited resources, I chose these three areas 
                        to focus on in the Build phase of my redesign, and made minor adjustments to the other areas.

                    <p>Based on my research and personas, I began brainstorming areas to improve on a blackboard. I wrote out the 
                        features each change would require and how they would help my personas complete their scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>After forming my initial plans, I made several changes to the Unsplash Landing Page by manipulating the CSS 
                        via the console. I have also created mock-ups of features to add or improve using 
                        <a href='https://www.figma.com/'> Figma</a> and <a href='https://www.gimp.org/'>GIMP</a>. The reasoning 
                        behind each of these changes, along with sample images, can be viewed below.</p>

                        <p style={{paddingTop: '10px'}}>This area underwent the largest cosmetic changes. Each change is listed below:</p>
                        <ol className='landing-list'>
                            <li>My user research showed that few users interacted with the long list of categories at the top 
                                of the page and I felt these would be better served incorporated behind a clickable options menu, 
                                as too many options competing for attention can lead to <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/reducing-cognitive-overload-for-a-better-user-experience/'>cognitive overload for the user</a>. I 
                                also changed “Editorial” to “Popular”, as <a href='https://uxdesign.cc/use-plain-language-in-ux-writing-d7d5b0ea35f1'>users prefer simple language they are familiar with</a>, 
                                and “Featured” to “In the Spotlight” to maintain the photographical theme of the site and to avoid 
                                needless repetition. Having just three options in the centre of the screen along with a sample of 
                                images visible underneath just above the fold should prevent <a href='https://usabilla.com/blog/paradox-choice-less-ux-design/'>paralysis of choice</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>My participants commented on the inviting nature of the “Join Now” button when they were logged out, so I hope that by 
                                adding a similar effect to the Submit button, this will incentivise photographers to contribute more pictures. The use of 
                                colour here is in line with similar uses throughout the site, and so remains in line with Unsplash’s minimalist colour 
                                palette. I considered adding an icon, but decided against the idea after reading <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/'>this article</a> and finding that I could not 
                                think of an appropriate image to use.</li>
                            <li>The Photo of the Day took up a lot of screen real estate, but still did not always give an accurate 
                                representation of the image on display. I have made it shorter both to invite users to look at a 
                                better representation by clicking on it, and to allow for the top of more images to be visible 
                                underneath the category selectors. This will hopefully please both users and customers who have 
                                paid for “Sponsored” images to appear at the top of the results list, as they are now partially 
                                visible without the need to scroll down.</li>
                            <li>I removed the “Home” and “Collections” buttons as they were rarely focused on by users and 
                                felt redundant when there were other options to accomplish the same task. I also moved the “More” 
                                menu dots to the corner of the screen. Again, this helps focus the user on the more common areas 
                                they may wish to use by incorporating greater white space.
                            </li>
                            <li>I shortened the search bar to make room for an “Advanced Search” option next to it with additional 
                                filters, as <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/'>the vast majority of users do not search for more than two words</a>. NB: This article 
                                offers some thoughts on the Advanced Search feature, but I believe my usage of it here does not contradict
                                any of the messages within.

                    <p>Taking inspiration from Unsplash’s competitor sites, Pexels and Pixabay, I fleshed out the autofill features 
                        to account for Users and Collections as well as pictures, making it clearer to users what they are able to 
                        search for. The tabs for Pictures, Users, and Collections are also slightly enlarged and given greater weight, 
                        as test participants sometimes struggled to see these options.

                    <p>To foster the sense of community Unsplash’s manifesto says they offer, I believe it is important to demonstrate that there are 
                        many other users of the site. Currently, download and view numbers are hidden behind another click when viewing images. By adding 
                        them to the first page, I hope this will demonstrate to the user that they are part of a large network all viewing and consuming 
                        these pictures. I hope this will encourage user engagement by <a href='forbesindia.com/article/brand-connect/gamification-in-ux-design-for-enhanced-user-experience-and-engagement/52075/1'>gamifying the process of submitting and viewing pictures</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many users also struggled with the task of finding images of a specific size. I have therefore clarified the use 
                        of the dropdown menu next to “Download” by making them both a distinct colour and added the resolution size of 
                        the image next to the download button in case users accidentally download an oversized image. I also added a 
                        small amount of colour to each icon to draw attention and allow for greater feedback when interacting with them. 
                        I added a <a href='https://uxplanet.org/ux-of-microinteractions-for-user-delight-fac1baed527a'> micro animation</a> of the heart expanding when users click and added a success message underneath to 
                        clarify what clicking the “Like”, “Add to Collection” or “Download” buttons did.

                    <p>Using the same participants as for my initial testing (again, due to time availability), I asked them to look 
                        over some of the changes to the site. I also asked them to complete tasks they initially struggled with, such 
                        as finding the Users and Collections tabs when searching, and downloading the correct size images. They 
                        expressed appreciation for the clearer error page information on failed searches. All of my participants found 
                        the tasks easier to complete than in the first round of usability testing.

                    <p>As this is a practice project, I was not able to complete more thorough testing of changes to the site. However, 
                        were I to have more time and access to participants and development, I would have conducted A/B testing with the 
                        original version of the site and my own changes to track how users interacted with both. I would consult 
                        analytics to track user journeys through the site and locate pain points to see if my changes had caused any 
                        unforeseen issues. Eye tracking may also be useful in seeing how users locate information on the site and whether 
                        adding small amounts of colour or increasing font weights had an effect on search speeds.</p>

                    <p>I found this project to be both enjoyable and educational. Conducting user research gave me an insight into how 
                        other users interact with the site that I had not considered myself and showed me how important it is to have a 
                        wide variety of participants with their own preconceptions and mental models. It taught me the importance of 
                        iteration, as I understood how my changes would themselves need to be tested to see whether they did actually improve 
                        the site, and also opened my eyes to the breadth of literature on UX design available online which I consulted to 
                        make my decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This was my first time working with a lot of the software I used to create the flowcharts and mock-ups featured 
                    here. I particularly enjoyed using Figma to add features I was not able to incorporate by only making adjustments 
                    to the site’s CSS via the console. In future, I want to learn more about similar software to create interactive 
                    prototypes for some of the more significant features I wanted to add with this redesign.
